            <div class="extra">Yes this is the first video on the website. Very nice :D<br>
                Can't wait to see how I'll be able to keep putting this to use, video site existing means YouTube isn't necessary anymore. Yes this site is hosted on GitHub, but even if I get banned I can just go to another host and be back up in a few minutes so yay. If I ever get the ability to do so, I'm self-hosting of course. WEBM is the way to go most likely for keeping smaller video sizes without ruining the quality too much especially if I don't soon figure out how to make videos work on Wii U browser or "New" 3DS.
